Normally, the $\textbf{gamma}$ values are set as -10 dBm, -20 dBm and so on (1e-4, 1e-5 in linear scale). The $\textbf{epsilon}$ value is chosen from -100 dB to 0 dB ($10^{-10}$ to 1 in linear scale). P will be fixed as 1/36$\approx$0.0278. 

For gamma = -20 dBm and the epsilon larger than about -55 dB, the problem will be infeasible.
